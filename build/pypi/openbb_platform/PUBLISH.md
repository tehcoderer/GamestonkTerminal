# Publishing to PyPI

Publishing checklist:

> Note: you need to have the appropriate credentials and permissions to publish to PyPI

1. Ensure all unit tests pass: `pytest openbb_platform -m "not integration"`
2. Ensure all integration tests pass: `pytest openbb_platform -m integration`
3. Run the publishing script: `python build/pypi/openbb_platform/publish.py`

    Consider using the `--dry-run` flag to check if everything is correct before publishing.
    Also, it might be a good idea to run the script in batches to ensure that the packages are published correctly and the dependencies pick the correct versions.
    Example, the `openbb-core` needs to pick the latest `openbb-provider` version and extension packages need to pick the latest `openbb-core` version.
    Suggested batch order:
    1. Batch 1. Core
       1. `openbb-provider`
       2. `openbb-core`
    2. Batch 2. Extensions
       1. `openbb-charting`
       2. `openbb-crypto`
       3. `openbb-currency`
       4. ...
    3. Batch 3. Toolkits
       1. `openbb-quantitative`
       2. `openbb-technical`
       3. `openbb-econometrics`
       4. ...
    4. Batch 4. Providers
       1. `openbb-alpha-vantage`
       2. `openbb-benzinga`
       3. `openbb-biztoc`
       4. ...
    5. Batch 5. The meta-packages
       1. `openbb`
            When publishing this package:
            - Bump the dependency package versions
            - Re-build the static assets that are bundled with the package

    > Note that, in order for packages to pick up the latest versions of dependencies, it might be necessary to clear the local cache of the dependencies:
    >
    > We can do that with `pip cache purge` and `poetry cache clear pypi --all`
    >
    > Also, sometimes there might be some delay in the PyPI API, so it might be necessary to wait a few minutes before publishing the next package.

4. Update poetry files: `python build/pypi/openbb_platform/poetry_update.py`
5. Open a PR so that changes are reflected on the main branch

Finally, check if everything works:

1. Install and test the package from Pypi on a clean environment.
2. Check if all the `pyproject.toml` files are correct, including the `openbb_platform` one.
3. Double check if there is any new extension or provider that needs to be added to [integration tests GitHub Action workflow](/.github/workflows/platform-api-integration-test.yml).
