OpenBB Add-In for Excel allows you to access your [data connectors](https://docs.openbb.co/pro/main-menu/data-connectors) from OpenBB Terminal Pro inside Microsoft Excel. This can be done using the [OBB.BYOD](https://docs.openbb.co/excel/reference/byod) function.

To access data from a [single widget](https://docs.openbb.co/pro/main-menu/data-connectors/single-widget) use:

```excel
=OBB.BYOD("widget_name")
```

To access data from your own [backend](https://docs.openbb.co/pro/main-menu/data-connectors/integrate-your-own-backend) use:

```excel
=OBB.BYOD("widget_name","backend_name")
```

If your backend supports it is possible to pass a symbol, date or other optional parameters:

```excel
=OBB.BYOD("widget_name","backend_name","my_symbol","my_date",{"param1":"value1","param2":"value2", ...})
```

:::tip
The easiest way to pass optional parameters is to write them into cells and reference them in the function. For example, `=OBB.BYOD(...,A1:B2)` where A1 contains "param1", B1 "value1", A2 "param2", B2 "value2" and so on.
:::

#### Additional notes

- Make sure your backend's CORS settings allow requests coming from <https://excel.openbb.co>.
- Requests via HTTP will be blocked by Excel. So if you are using the Add-in for Excel on Mac or Office on the web with Safari browser you need to run your backend via HTTPS.
