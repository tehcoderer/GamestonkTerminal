The Contributor Guidelines are intended to be a continuation of the [Developer Guidelines](/platform/contributing/developer-guidelines/expecations_for_developers). They are not a replacement, but rather an expansion, focusing specifically on those who seek to directly enhance the OpenBB Platform's codebase. It's crucial for Contributors to be familiar with both sets of guidelines to ensure a harmonious and productive engagement with the OpenBB Platform.

There are many ways to contribute to the OpenBB Platform. You can add a [new data point](/platform/contributing/developer-guidelines/add_data_point), add a [new command](/platform/contributing/developer-guidelines/add_custom_data_sources#openbb-platform-commands), add a [new visualization](/openbb_platform/extensions/charting/README.md), add a [new extension](/platform/contributing/developer-guidelines/build_openbb_extensions), fix a bug, improve or create documentation, etc.
