<HeadTitle title="Overview - Usage | OpenBB Platform Docs" />

At its base, the OpenBB Platform supplies core architecture and services for connecting data providers and extensions, consumable through the Python client or the Fast API.
The extension framework provides interoperability between as many, or few, services required.

Optional extras are not included with the base installation, and these include:

- Charting libraries and views
- Data processing and calculations
- Technical/Quantitative Analysis
- Community data providers
- Toolkit extensions
- CLI Terminal

Additional functionality and data providers can be installed or removed independently. Refer to [Extensions](extensions) for the list of extensions hosted in the OpenBB GitHub repository.

The pages in this section cover topics to get started using the OpenBB Platform, including:

- [Authorization and API Keys](usage/api_keys)
- [Launching the REST API](usage/rest_api)
- [User Settings and Environment Variables](usage/settings_and_environment_variables)
- [Basic Response](usage/basic_response)
- [Basic Syntax](usage/basic_syntax)
- [Explanations](usage/explanation)
