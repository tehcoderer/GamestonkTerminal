<HeadTitle title="Data - Extensions | OpenBB Platform Docs" />

Data extensions will expand the breadth and coverage of the data available in the OpenBB Platform. Each source (provider) is its own independent extension, even if there is only one endpoint accessible. This allows every data source to be inserted or removed, at any time, without disturbing the operation of the Core components.

Functions will appear in the Python Interface and Fast API only if a supported provider, for that specific endpoint, is installed. Additional Python libraries will be installed, where required, by the extension.

## Provider Coverage

The total installed coverage can be determined through the Python interface, as a dictionary.

```python
from openbb import obb
obb.coverage.providers
```

## Installation

All data extensions are installed with similar syntax. Published data extensions will have names beginning with `openbb`. For example, yFinance.

```console
pip install openbb-yfinance
```

Additions and removals update the router automatically to reflect the changes when the Python interpreter is refreshed. Below is a list of data provider extensions.

Uninstall any extension with `pip uninstall`.

```console
pip uninstall openbb-yfinance
```
