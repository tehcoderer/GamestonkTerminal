## Using OpenBB Cookie-Cutter

The OpenBB cookie-cutter approach provides a standardized way to host your data and integrate it into widgets. This method is versatile and can be used whether your data is hosted internally or externally. Here's how to get started:

1. **Prepare the `widgets.json` file**: This file defines widget properties such as name, description, category, type, endpoint, and more. Make sure it's well-structured. See an example below.

2. **Set up the OpenBB API**: Follow the OpenBB API documentation to set up your API. Implement the necessary endpoints that align with the widget definitions in the `widgets.json` file.

3. **Integrate endpoints**: Define the appropriate endpoint for each custom widget in the `widgets.json` file. This endpoint connects your API to the widget.

4. **Configure widgets**: Users can add the custom widgets using the Terminal Pro interface by providing the relevant endpoint details.

## Using Language-Agnostic API

The language-agnostic API approach offers flexibility by allowing you to use the programming language and tools that best suit your needs. You can host this API internally or externally, making it accessible to the Terminal Pro widgets. Here's how:

1. **Design and implement your API**: Choose your preferred programming language and framework. Ensure that the API can return data in JSON format, which is required for widget integration.

2. **Create widget definitions**: As with the OpenBB API approach, create corresponding definitions for your custom widgets in the `widgets.json` file. Specify the API endpoint, name, description, category, type, etc.

3. **Connect widgets to your API**: Once your API is up and running, users can add the custom widgets using the Terminal Pro interface. They just need to input the endpoint details, and the widget will fetch and display the data from your API.

## Using OpenBB Native Integrations

The OpenBB native integrations allows you to connect to Snowflake, MySQL, or SQLite databases directly. You can run any query against your database directly from our terminal.

1. **Install our Client**: Reach out to us [here](mailto:colin.delahunty@openbb.finance?subject=Data%20Connector) to receive your free client.

2. **Run the Client**: Simply click on our app and type in the port you would like to use. If you are unsure of a good port, feel free to select `Recommend Port`.

3. **Connect inside the Terminal Pro**: Once your client is up and running, click [here](https://pro.openbb.co/app/data-connectors) to enable the connectors. Now feel free to enter login credentials for any Snowflake, MySQL, or SQLite database and begin to analyze your data inside of our terminal.

### Quick Start with Python and FastAPI

Our team has created several examples that you can use to quickly get started with Python and FastAPI. For more information, check [this open source repository](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/backend-for-terminal-pro/tree/main) for examples.
