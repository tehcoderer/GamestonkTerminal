The single widget is the most straightforward method to integrate your custom data into OpenBB Terminal Pro. Simply paste your API endpoint into the data connectors tab, and voila! Your data is fetched and displayed in a user-friendly table format.

To use this feature, input your API endpoint and any necessary connection information. The widget will then dynamically load and present your data within the Terminal Pro interface.

If your endpoint requires additional headers, don't worry. You can easily add them using the '+ Add Additional Headers' button.

In addition, if your API endpoint doesn't return a a simple JSON but a nested architecture, you will be prompted with a "Data Key" parameter which you can use to grab the data of interest.

If you want to do something more custom, you should look into creating [your own backend](/pro/data-connectors/integrate-your-own-backend), or reach out to OpenBB for support.
