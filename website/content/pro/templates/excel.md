<HeadTitle title="Excel Templates | OpenBB Terminal Pro Docs" />

When navigating to the Templates page and clicking on the Excel tab, this is what the user will be able to see. As you can see from the image below, the user will be able to see a list of Excel templates that have been created by the OpenBB team and that leverage our Add-in for Excel to automate financial workflows.

Once clicking on "Download Template" (e.g. for "Equity Analysis"), users will be able to access an Excel spreadsheet like the one shown below.

If you have your OpenBB Add-in for Excel installed (instructions [here](/excel/getting-started/installation)) you will be able to change a ticker on the spreadsheet and all the values are automatically updated.

More templates will be added in the next few weeks.
