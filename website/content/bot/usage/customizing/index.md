<HeadTitle title="Customizing - Usage | OpenBB Bot Docs" />

For the best user experience, you will want to customize the OpenBB Bot settings. Different types of customizations we offer are:
<div className="flex">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>INDIVIDUAL</strong>: Allows to customize chart themes, add technical analysis indicators in the chart, create alerts and watchlists
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>SERVER</strong>: Allows to customize chart settings, autoposting for members of your server and billboard message (for announcements).
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

In Order to you customize you will need to link your account. You can find this under [Linked Platforms](https://my.openbb.co/app/bot/linked-platforms) on the Hub Page - an explanation of how to link is provided there.

<div className="flex justify-center h-full w-[800px] rounded-r-[4px]">

    src="https://openbb-web-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/docusaurus-openbb-bot-walkthrough-gifs/page2.gif"
  />
  </div>

Now that your account is linked - lets dive into what you can do on the next pages.
